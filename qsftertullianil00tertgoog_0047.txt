Offili- there are two points to whiob the attention may be
*--diroeted; the evidenoe ol testimony and the evidence ol'
aryamentr the first through the medium of those rules
whioh gnide us in every transaction oi lile, and by whioh
the sooiety of the human rane is preserved, establisbes
oedein ooourrenees as mettere offam the seoond is oon·.
cerned in proving the same proposition by relerenoe to
their probability, their analogy to other ooourrenees, their
objeet, their utility, and a variety ol' eiroumstanees of
the like nature; one asserts the truth, the· other the
reasonableness, ol' a soheme. Both these may of eourse
be united, and directed to the same end; a welloon-
stituted mind will admit the sufficienoy ol the first prool.
and aequiesoe in its consequentes, but with others no
ooneeivable eompleteness of the evidenoe ol testimony is
allowed to prevail against a presumed delieienoy in the.
evidence of argument, an evidenoe always indefinite, and
varying in eaoh individual ease as to the fulness and
oharaoter requirite to seoure its aooeptanee, so that an
exclusive appeal to it amounts to little more than an,
unlimited olaim to private judgment in every imaginable. .
oense. This point will be found ffifflussed at some length
and with considerable aeuteness in Cioero's very inte
. testing treatise De Divinatione, where the, testimonies
sor that partioular kind ol‘ supernatural interserente are
alleged in the. first book, and the arguments ayoiaa it
produced in the seoond; the two following sentences will
give the reader the pith of eaoh, and some. inferenoe
may be drawn aa to the probable opinions ol an edn-
oated heathen on this subject.

A. Si nihil queam disputare, quamobrem quidque,
fiat, et tantummodo, fieri ea, quae oommemoravi, dooeam ε,
parum ne respondeam! (1. 49.)

B. Hoo ego philosophi non esse arbitror, testibus

uti: qui aut casu veri, aut malitia falsi fletique esse
