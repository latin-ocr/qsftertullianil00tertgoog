ΟΝ THE usurum OF THE ararem FATHERS· XXl

phrase. Arnobius has some resemblance to Apuleius, CHAP·
his descriptione are 01 the most astonishing luxuriante—¹2-
they wander through page after page with all kinds of
rhetorical embellishments: he has very frequent examples
01 that involution of construction mentioned above, but
the general arrangement 01 his sentences aud periods is
remarkably constant, so that after an attentive perusal
of a, few chapters the reader may know exactly where
to expect the epithets and the verbs, aud precisely an·

which others have given him so much credit for, is the
most disagreeable 01 all stylos, a spiritless imitation 01
Ciceronian Latin, the wealmess 01 which is particularly
apparent after the perusal of Tertullian. It happens
that there are several passages² in these two authors so
parallel in substance that they ean be most advantage-

compensate for a total absence 01 vividness or vigour.
If Cicero must needs be the soleand exclusive exemplar

gentlemanly deferenee 10 a friend's opinion, or a polite
dissent from a self-evident absurdity. Many scholars
have stood up in defense 01 Tertullian's arguments, but
all, except Gilbert Wakefield, have joined in deerying
his Latinity as preeminently vicious. 1 can only say
