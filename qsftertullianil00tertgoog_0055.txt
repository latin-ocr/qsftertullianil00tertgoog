-L-is oi a character so peculiar that it is difficult to treat

” it in any satisfactory manner. The steps are simply

these: The writer first (c. 22) asserts the existence,

and describes the qualities‚ ol spiritual bciugs called .

shall content mysell here with directing the readsr's

attention to what appear tome the remarkable points

ol' the case. And first, it is to be specially observed

Next, I advent to the singular decision aud boldness with

which he chalenge ao anal (aar lc araas, &a

issue, as he says himself (qwid leae prolatione fidelius,
p. 89), and further, particularly to the strange and un-

designed testimony conyeyed in the argument (p.127)‚
