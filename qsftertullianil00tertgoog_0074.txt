his book is devoted to the discussion of his adversary's
points in detail. He does not protest absolutely against
the toleration ol Paganism, but he vehemently dissuades
the Emperor lrom protesting it; he urges that the
Christiane never applied for stategrants, but would have
always been content oould they have esoaped perseeu-

uestals riehly salaried, magnifieently lodged, and pompously
honoured, with the unobtrusive eelibaey of whole congre· ·

of the Christiane under tortures and death, with the
