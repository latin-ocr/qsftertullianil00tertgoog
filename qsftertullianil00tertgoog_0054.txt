ticular attention to it by a httle further consideration. ...E-

The most singular difference between ancient and medem

scepticism, and consequently between ancient and modern
apologista, 10 10 their respective views 01 the miracles.
The generation which witnessed these doings, and the
generations which immediately succeeded, never expressed
the slightest doubt as 10 the fact 01 their oocurrence;
they might explain away the prodigy by attributing it
10 100810, 01 they might invalidate its inflncnce by setting
up rival claime, but no ancient opponent 01 Christianity,

as 101 as my reading and memory enable me to speak,
ever thought 01 1100011108 that the historical testimony

10 the miracles was either insufficient or inconclusive.
Even Hierocles himself, as we are expressly, though in÷

cidentally, told by Lactantius², acknowledged this mueh;

and accordingly we find that contemporary apologista
010 occupied in proving that the miracles were 001 010-
81001, and that the claims 01 Apollonius 01 Apuleius to
similar powers are totally unfouuded. But modern scep-
ticism takes other ground, and declares not only that
the existing evidence 101 the miracles is insufficient‚ but
that 00 conceivablc addition to it could make it effee- Ι
tual, and therefore 001 apologists also change the ancient
position, and have now to prove facts which 101 000-
1111100 aftcr their occurrence no one ever doubted, and
the complcteness 01 evidence which no manen any other
subject would think 01 questioning. Grotius, Ι think,
10 the last 011110 apologista who devotos 0 chapter 10
10101108 the charge 01 010810. Eye witnesses saw the
works, but doubted the ageucy: 100 deny the laets, and
dismiss the cause.

But now 10 return to Tertullian's proci 3-hall' 01

Μ111010 tamen quum 10010 000 tamen negaret, voluit‚’' &c
ejus (Christilmirabilia detrucret, D. I. v. 3.
