The adversaries to whom the apologetic writings would
be chiefly addreseed, may be divided into three principal
classem the Pagans, who supported, either from uprigbt
or interested motives the old religion, such as Symmachus,
whose Apology for Paganism will be presently noticed ;¹
the philosophers who either ridiculed or allegorized it, and
the J ews. In the first class was to be found that vast
multitude of converte which was to fulfil the prophecies
of Scripture, and with these, if sincerely diepoeed to

the representation of their deitiee in a true light would
be specially efficacious. In the second was a far smaller,

receding direotly from Christianity, some making a kind
of approximation to its doctrines, but all nearly equally
