in its passage from Rome to Carthago, from Oioero to Cillan,
Tertullian. I have been less sparing in my illustratione 42-
than Ι perhaps otherwise might have been, beoaose my
object was as muoh an introduction to the ordinary
style ol the Latin Fathers‚ and a general recommen-
dation to aoouraey in their perusal‚ as an explanation
or eommentary on this partioular treatise‚ which indeed
I only took beoause Ι thought that general assistanoe
would be best given through the medium of a parti-

marks on the Apologetio writings of the early Gh1istians‚
whioh inolude a speoial examination os the divisione, the
arguments, and the spirit, of the present traot. Most
readers will probably be aware that Tertullian oomposed
two books od Nationes for the same purpose as the
Apology‚ and whioh correspond so olosely with it that
they must be eithara rough draught of it, or an im-
perfeot oopy; these of oonrse are peouliarly valnable in
