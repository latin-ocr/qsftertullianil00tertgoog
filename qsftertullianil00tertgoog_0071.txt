Cffil’· Mam nullam mamm rai olimpias emunit, aa illa qai

The latter says, Falsa dealem radarguere aaa potest nisi
qai sobal oete qaid sit omma. Arnobius deelines the
question of the existence of evil; Laetautius says it is
neeessary to the formation of its eontrary, good. And
his reasoning isperpetually of suoh a kind, whieh his
subjeot gare him endless opportunities of displaying or

point about him, his appeals to Hermes and the eibyt
may possibly be more defensible than we imagine; he

I have here set this writer in the most favourable
light inv whioh he ean be viewed, and offered the most·
partial explanation of his design and its prosecution.
But there is another hypothesis ,which will as easily
explain the singularities of his argument, and whieh will
quioldy suggest itself to his readers. He was a man of
exoessive vanity, with unhesitating confidenee in his own
