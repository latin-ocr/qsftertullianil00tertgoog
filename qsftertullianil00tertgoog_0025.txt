the assistanee whieh Ι notieed as supplied from other
apologista, and Ι have plaoed marginal references to the
eorresponding passages both in these and in the Apo
logy of Justin Merop, that they may he thus compared.
Ι believe Ι have only one more remark to add respeet-
ing the notes. Dr Λώτου, Master ol this eollege through
the first half of the last oentury‚ boqueathed to the
library several volumes enriehed with his MS. notes, and
amongst themtlm leydeneditionofthistreatiseby
Havereamp‚ 1718. These notes are principally oeoupied
in reinting and exposing the views ol Haveroamp (whieh
indeed was no diffioult matter) bnt they show very good
soholarship and olear perception ol the anthor's true
meaning. A levv ol these annotatione by the permission
ol the eollege, Ι have seleoted3 they are given in the
original Latin oi the Master, enolosed within brackets
and distinguished hythe initial A at the leot. The
text has been taken mainly from the small Leipsio edi-
tion of 1841, by Leopold‚ with some few emendations
of other editors; I have made no alteration or addi-
tion myself.

The whole of the sheets eontaiuing the text and
notes had passed through the prese, when the English
translation ol thie Apology appeared amongst the peri·
odioal volumes of the Angla-Catholio Soeiety3 I heve
not yet had time to read it, hut if it should prove
that any ol' my interpretatione ol disputed passages eoin-
eide with the translator's views‚ I shall be very glad
ol the sanction and support of sneh publicatione.
