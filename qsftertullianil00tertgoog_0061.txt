theee the two fimt propositione arc proved hythe rame
argrumente and almost by the eame worde which occur
in Minutiun, aud the laet hyan equally close transcript
ol Tertullian¹. The only passage worth particular re
markis the concluding paragraph, in which Cyprian states
that the Christiane arc permitted to be tortured in order
that the proofs of the truth may be more absolute (aa

the touehstone of truth (dolor coiectis tedia), which is
indeed the argument ol Paley‚ except that the latter
confines it to the oeae ol eye-witneseee, and to mettere
ol' lact. It ia hard to pronounoe upon an apologetic
waiting without a thorough knowledge of the individuale
to whom it was addreesed or the special occasion which
called it forth, and perhaps either or both ol these eir-
cumstanees might account for what appear imperfectione
in these tracte; but euch reaeoning as ie horrowed ie
