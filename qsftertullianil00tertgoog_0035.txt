I have notieed (p. 121) one instanoe in whioh even
Mosheim was strangely misl'ed, and Ι have pointed out
in the notes the examples of this singular praetioe as
they occurred. The young student of Tertullian ean
never be too muoh on his guard on this point.
While speaking of Tertullian's style, there is one
singular oiroumstanoe to whioh I may allude. That
Semler surmised and endeavoured to prove that, the
whole of Tertullian's works were spurious, and the pro-
duotion of a joint-stook establishment at Rome, is pro·
bably known to many through Bishop Kaye's refutation
of the argument (Eeol. Hist. p. 69, sqq.) But, apart
from all sueh reasoning, I am at a loss to oonoeivo
how suoh an idea could over have been entertained by
, any one who had been aooustomed to eompare the
genuino and oounterfeit writings of antiquity. Not to
mention the eamestness, the reality, of Tertullian's works,
oould any rhetorioian possibly have devised sueh a style
as this? or oould he have preserved it throughout? or
eould any body else suooessfully have imitated ite It
is aotually impossible. ’
There is nothing very peouliar about the language of
Cyprian3 neither his mind nor his style had the deeply-
out 'features ol Tertullian3 he was thought eloquent in
¹ his day, too eloquent indeed, by the heathen, for a snb
jeot 'so insignifieant as relig'on¹; his sentences (eompa-
ratively) run fluently and smoothly, and he often explains
some sententious dietum ol Tertullian by a luoid para·

busforte scripta ejus innotuerunt, bns aptum, ad aniles fabriles oon-
derideri solet . . . · quasi qui ele· tulisset? Laetant. D. Ι. v. i.
