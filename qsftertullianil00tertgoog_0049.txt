tur. Tertullian endeavours to prove not that J esus Christ
was the Son ot⁴ God, or that the Evangelists lel't a true
and harmonious narrative, but that infantieide and in-
esst were not orimes ol the Christiana, that their as-
semblios were not seditione, and that their habits were
neither hurtlul to soeiety, nor vioions in themselves. Ιι

This therefore is evidently the portion ol' the 'Apology
