fully, that they exclusively contaiu that particular kind
ol apologetic evidence which I am considering in this

defenee of the individual or congregational practices of
the Christiane, and shews most clearly that main ob-

One or two points Ι wish to notice. ¹ The history ol
the Roman empire during the first few centurias of
Christianity will secure easy eredeuee to the narra·
tives ol those calamities which are described as then
falling with cverwhclming weight on the human raee.
With such a government‚ and such a succession to the
throne, with legions of sueh a class, and national cha
racter at such a stage cs decay, with civil wars almost
perpetual, and barbarian irruptions gradually more bhreat·
ing, we need be at no loss to account for ruined cities
aud devastated territorias, for pestilence‚ lor lamine or
lor blood, and the coincidence of the more awlul and
destructive phenomena of nature would be readily con-
nected in the minds ol the sufferers with the terrers
of human infliction. But as early as the close ol the
second century these events had been all laid to the charge
¹ol the Christiana, who were said to have provoked the

ancient gods to this exhibition ol their reality and wrath.
