lrey too, whieh will give aorem afterwards to whatever '
treasures are needed. Ι may here add the reasons whiah
induoed me to seleet ior my operatione this writer, and
this espeoial treatise.

Tertullian is not only one of the most renowned,
but he is the earliest oi all the Latin Fathers‚ and
this priority ol date is of even more than usual oohse·
quenoe from the influenoe whioh his singular powers
exerted on his suooessors, and which perpetuated 'certain
oharaoteristios through the writers of the Airioan ohuroh
for many years alter him. His works too are the· most
important, exoepting those ol S. Augustino, both as re-
gards the⁴4period ιι whioh they were written, and the
mass ol various information whioh they oonvey. More
over, they are moomparably the most difficule, they shew
the student the worst at enee, and tell him what he has
ιο expeot; at the very ontset he meets all the peon-
liarities of adeolining language, of provincial, theologioal
andpolemioal Latin, and he ιιι, ιι all events, oonsole him-
aelswith the reileotion that he will not be muoh perplexed
with any other peges after mastering these. lt may be oh
served though, that Tertullian has adonhle style, one ior
eaoh of two distinet speeies of composition-his controver-
aial, and his ethioal, or apologetia traots; and the first of
these lorms of itselfa separate study, and a serious one
too. Not only has his methodos argument to be‘ traoed,

¹ his fidelity to be tested, and the worth oihis witnesses

to be weighed-whioh indeed are requisita preparatione

in most other cases-but his very language and its

stnature- assume a new and peruliar ohnraeten strange

words are oompounded to express strange and mystioal
things, till ιι length the Latin tongue seems to fail ,

’ absolutely in finding terms lor the metaphysios or oos-
