We shall preseutly see the different views taken hy
the apologista of this subject amougst others, aud our
eud will be best auswered hy eramiuiug first the apo·
logy of Τοιιιιιιίιιιι, so that by using this ss a oriterion
to whieh the others may be applied, we shall themora
easily deteot their mutual differente or agreement on
any eonsiderahle points, and observo better the ends
whioh they respectively proposed to themselves, and the
