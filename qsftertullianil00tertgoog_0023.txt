CHAP. 'which Tertulliani lashes‚ we see the theatres and spec·
...IL-..tedes against which he declaims, we attend the pomps
and festivals of the deities which he exposes, andare
introduced to the dark practices and magical arte to which
he so frequently refers. And though it will be readily
perceived how much even the knowledge of these eir„-
urmstances is calculated te illustrate peculiarities of
phraseology, yet· still more apposite aid ean be procured
from theremains I speak of. Not only are all these
communicatione eonveyed in the same provincial dialect,
and what is more, bya writer of similar education and
analogous lites-ary taste, but we have actually a coun-
terpart composition, an. apology of Apuleius, as well as
of Tertullian‚ written indeed in a widely different spirit,
pleading for private acquittal instead of public justice,
refuting dirty scandal, instead of popular calumnies, sa·
vouring vastly more of ingenuity than innoeence, but
still written by an eloquent African, spoken before a
'Roman proconsul in a Carthaginien corut, addressed to
the same ears to which the Christiana pleaded‚ and
possibly to many who might afterwards have read the ’
. apolegy· of Tertullian. The very difference of these two
productione is interesting and instructius, and while seiz·
inge parallel idiom or a corresponding term it is edi-
fying to eontrast the confident complacency of an absolute
rhetorieian, with the serious and passionate tone of a
man pleading for his life and for the truth. I have =
, availed myself much and often of this author's aid on
points of verbal criticism. ln order too, that the pecu-
liarities of the language which we are considering might
be more exactly apprehended, Ι have frequently quoted
the earlier or the intermediate Latin writers, either for
an identical or an analogous expression, so that the
transition sense ofa word might be occasionally shewn,
and the various changes exhibited which it experienced
