neither a translation nor a text of the patristio writings
is sufficient for the wauts of the ordinary student. Of
the first it need only he said, that all the well-known
objections to versione even the most lahoured and carehrl,

second; the confession of the committee themselves with
respect to the author, whose works we are about to
enter upon, will shew how muoh more remeius to be
done before the bam text of an African presbyter can
be made available for reference or researeh. Nor is there
any thing strange in the fact, that so much difficulty
should be experienced in decyphering the Latin Fathers.

small number who can bring the requisite aid to the
critical perusal of the Fathers, or who cau master their
style without very considerable trouble and delay; while
