polized by the exereises of the schools. An orerwhelm- -ss-
ing importunae would be attached to such proprieties
or beauties of speech as the fashiou of the day had
sanctioned, to the comparative exclusion of thought, or
even truth, as objects of consideration. Apuleius says
iu one of his speeches, that he knows his audienee
will not pardon bima single mistake‚ or excuse a single
solecism, or overlook a single mispronunciation³, and he
exhibits iu his own productiones most remarkable por-
trait of the character formed under this system, and
amost complete picture of what was demanded by an
African audieuce. His celebrated apology, the master-
piece of the day, the admiration of eren Christian writers⁴,
is a deliberate display of all the arte, powers, and,
subtleties of rhetoric; truth, though repeatedly appealed
to, is virtually put out of the question; the orator
plays with the charges against him like a master of
fence with a couple of raw antagonists, after rebutting
an accusation he offers to acknowledge it, and clear
himself on another ground, his opponents may take as
many points as they like to make the game even, he
has no objection to plead guilty, or not guilty, his
final exculpation of himself ¹ will be just as successful iu
either ease. We ean be at no loss after reading the
apology of Apuleius, to understand the meaning of Ter·
tullian, when he says, Quas nos, revincere audebit, arou
arte cadomus, sed eadem formu qao probationem eonsti-
tuc’mue da ceritatef lt is not the least singular point
about this extraordinary speech, that one of the '‘charges
against the speaker was aa cloquecce.
